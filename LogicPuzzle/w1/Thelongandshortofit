The Long and the Short of It:
Hereâ€™s a great logic puzzle for kids: Six neighborhood children 
(Leisha, Benito, Delia, Charlotte, Weldon, and Zina) were measured yesterday.
Case 1 : Weldon is taller than Delia but shorter than Zina.
             Zina> Weldon >Delia 
Case 2 : Leisha is taller than Benito but shorter than Delia and Weldon.
           Delia & Weldon >  Lisha>Benito
       ** Delia is shorten than weldon  ** Zina is taller than Weldon
         Weldon > Delia > Lisah > Benito
           
Case 3 : Benito is not the shortest.

         Zina >Weldon > Delia > Lisah > Benito >Charlotte 
Need someone to be the shortest so charlotte must to be the shortest .

Answer : "Zina is the longest and Charlotte is the shortest ."
